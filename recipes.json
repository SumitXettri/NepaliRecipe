Ensure the grill is clean and lightly oiled to prevent sticking.\nThread the marinated mutton pieces onto skewers, leaving small gaps between pieces to allow even cooking.\nPlace the skewers on the grill and cook, turning occasionally to ensure all sides are evenly charred.\nWhile grilling, baste the mutton pieces with a little mustard oil to enhance flavor and prevent drying out.\nGrill until the mutton is tender, slightly charred on the edges, and cooked through. Internal temperature should reach around 70–75°C (160–167°F).\nRemove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.\nServe the grilled mutton hot alongside chiura (beaten rice) and your favorite achar (pickles) for an authentic Nepali experience.",
